# group_27_project

A collaborative Bio Data Science project for the DTU course R for Bio Data Science (22100). The goal is to apply the full data science cycle to a biological dataset, focusing on reproducibility, collaborative coding, and extraction of biological insights using R and Quarto.

The contents of the repository are the following: 
- an `.Rproj` file to run the repository as a project in RStudio 
- the R folder containing all the `.qmd` Quarto documents needed for the steps from loading the data to the analysis 
- the results folder containing the plots and rendered files produced from the R folder 
- the doc folder containing the final presentation

The dataset used contains joined clinical and gene expression data for ovarian cancer patients. They can be found by following the links below: 
- [Clinical dataset](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?dataset=TCGA-OV.clinical.tsv&host=https%3A%2F%2Fgdc.xenahubs.net&removeHub=https%3A%2F%2Fxena.treehouse.gi.ucsc.edu%3A443) 
- [Gene expression dataset](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?dataset=TCGA-OV.star_fpkm.tsv&host=https%3A%2F%2Fgdc.xenahubs.net&removeHub=https%3A%2F%2Fxena.treehouse.gi.ucsc.edu%3A443)

When rendering the `00_all.qmd` the data is automatically loaded from the above websites.
