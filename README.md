# group_27_project
A collaborative Bio Data Science project for the DTU course R for Bio Data Science (22100). The goal is to apply the full data science cycle to a biological dataset, focusing on reproducibility, collaborative coding, and extraction of biological insights using R and Quarto.

The contents of the repository are the following:
- an `.Rproj` file to run the repository as a project in RStudio
- the R folder containing all the `.qmd` Quarto documents needed for the steps from loading the data to the analysis
- the results folder containing the plots and rendered files produced from the R folder
- the doc folder containing the final presentation

The dataset used contains joined clinical and gene expression data for ovarian cancer patients. They can be found by following the links below:
