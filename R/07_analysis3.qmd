## Differential expression analysis

## Aim

In this document, we run a simple differential expression analysis to see whether gene expression differs between patients who were alive or dead at follow-up.

## Setup

```{r}
# Load packages
library("tidyverse")
```

## Load augmented data

```{r}
# Load the augmented dataset
full_data <- readRDS("../data/data_augmented.rds")

# Show 10 random rows to check the data
full_data |> slice_sample(n = 10)

```

## Filter to samples with known vital status

We first keep only the samples where the alive variable is not missing. Then, we check how many samples fall into each group.

```{r}

# Filter samples with known alive status
# We remove samples where alive is missing
full_data_alive <- full_data |> filter(!is.na(alive))

# Count how many samples are alive vs dead
full_data_alive |>
  distinct(sample, alive) |>
  count(alive)

```

## Differential expression per gene

For each gene, we compare log2 expression between alive (alive == TRUE) and dead (alive == FALSE) patients using a two-sample t-test.

```{r}
# Differential expression for each gene
# We compare log2 expression between alive and dead patients
de_results <- full_data_alive |>
  group_by(Ensembl_ID) |>
  summarise(
    # Mean expression in alive patients
    mean_alive = mean(log2_expression[alive], na.rm = TRUE), 
    # Mean expression in dead patients
    mean_dead = mean(log2_expression[!alive], na.rm = TRUE), 
    # Log2 fold change: alive - dead
    log2_fc = mean_alive - mean_dead, 
    # Two-sample t-test for alive vs dead
    p_value = tryCatch(t.test(log2_expression ~ alive)$p.value, error = function(e) NA_real_), 
            .groups = "drop") |>
  # Adjust p-values for multiple testing (FDR)
  mutate(p_adj = p.adjust(p_value, method = "BH"))


# Show the first 10 results
de_results |>
  slice_head(n = 10)
```

## **Summary of differential expression**

We check how many genes remain significant after controlling for multiple testing (FDR \< 0.05).

```{r}
# Summary of significant genes
# We check how many genes have FDR < 0.05
de_summary <- de_results |>
  filter(!is.na(p_adj)) |>
  summarise(n_genes = n(),
            n_significant = sum(p_adj < 0.05),
            prop_significant = n_significant / n_genes)

de_summary
```

Only 2 out of 14,157 genes are significant at FDR \< 0.05 (around 0.014%). This suggests that differences between alive and dead patients are extremely small, which matches what we saw in the PCA: the two groups do not separate clearly in expression space.

## Volcano plot

Here, we create a volcano plot showing log2 fold changes and adjusted p-values. Genes with FDR \< 0.05 are highlighted.

```{r}
# Prepare data for volcano plot
# - log2 fold changes on x-axis
# - -log10(FDR) on y-axis
volcano_data <- de_results |>
  filter(!is.na(p_adj)) |>
  mutate(neg_log10_p = -log10(p_adj),
         significant = p_adj < 0.05)

# Volcano plot
volcano_plot <- volcano_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = log2_fc, y = neg_log10_p, colour = significant)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Differential expression: alive vs dead",
       x = "log2 fold change (alive - dead)",
       y = "-log10 adjusted p-value",
       colour = "FDR < 0.05")

volcano_plot

```

```{r}
# Save the volcano plot
ggsave(filename = "../results/07_volcano_alive_vs_dead.png",
       plot = volcano_plot,
       width = 7,
       height = 5)
```

The volcano plot confirms that only a few genes are significant. Most points lie close to zero on the x-axis, meaning the fold changes are very small. So overall, vital status has only a weak influence on gene expression.

## Top differentially expressed genes

We extract the 3 genes with the smallest adjusted p-values.

```{r}
# Select the top 3 most significant genes
top_de_genes <- de_results |>
  filter(!is.na(p_adj)) |>
  arrange(p_adj) |>
  slice_head(n = 3)

top_de_genes

```

These genes show the strongest association between expression and vital status according to this simple model.

## Boxplots for those 3 genes

To visualise the differences directly, we create boxplots for the top 3 genes.

```{r}
# Boxplots for the top 3 genes
# We show expression by alive status
top3_ids <- top_de_genes |>
  slice_head(n = 3) |>
  pull(Ensembl_ID)

boxplot_data <- full_data_alive |>
  filter(Ensembl_ID %in% top3_ids) |>
  mutate(Ensembl_ID = factor(Ensembl_ID, levels = top3_ids))

gene_boxplot <- boxplot_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = alive, y = log2_expression, fill = alive)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ Ensembl_ID, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 3 differentially expressed genes",
    x = "Alive status",
    y = "log2(expression + 1)")

gene_boxplot
```

```{r}
# Save the boxplots
ggsave(filename = "../results/07_boxplots_alive_vs_dead.png",
       plot = gene_boxplot,
       width = 7,
       height = 5)

```

For these genes, expression tends to be slightly higher in patients who are alive, but the differences remain small. Even for the most significant genes, the effect size is limited, which supports the idea that vital status has only a subtle impact on gene expression.

## Conclusion

This differential expression analysis shows that gene expression is almost identical between alive and dead patients at follow-up. Out of \~14,157 genes, only two pass the FDR threshold, and their fold changes are small.

These results match the PCA: the two groups do not form distinct transcriptomic profiles, and the main variation in the dataset is driven by other factors.

Overall, the transcriptome does not show a strong or clear signature of survival status in this dataset.
